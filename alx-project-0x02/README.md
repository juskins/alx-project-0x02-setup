# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and practical implementation of Next.js fundamentals. It demonstrates the setup and configuration of a Next.js project, showcasing essential concepts such as:

- **Component Architecture**: Reusable components including Cards, Buttons, Modals, and Navigation Headers
- **Page Routing**: Implementation of multiple pages (Home, About, Posts, Users) with Next.js file-based routing
- **Data Fetching**: Server-side rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) using `getStaticProps`
- **API Integration**: Fetching data from external APIs (JSONPlaceholder) to display posts and user information
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strongly-typed interfaces and components for enhanced code quality
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS implementation with dark mode support
- **Best Practices**: Modern React patterns, component composition, and Next.js optimization techniques

This project is designed to help developers understand the core concepts of Next.js and build scalable, performant web applications.
